# Keegan, as your manager
Hey there! I am so excited to be on your team and serving as your manager. My goal is to make Flywheel a place where you can do your best work. </br> 
</br> 
I am here to support you in your role, help you grow and learn, and advocate for you within the rest of the company. </br> 
What is this document? </br> 
</br> 
As your manager, it is my responsibility to clearly state 1) how I work, 2) what I value, and 3) who I am. This document will cover those things. The goal is to help you spend less time speculating these things so you can spend more time doing your job building some awesome products! </br> 
</br> 
Please note, this is a work in progress! I see this as a living document and will make modifications as I grow as a manager. I will always let you know if any changes are made so you always know what to expect of me and what is expected of you. 

## 1. How I work</br> 
I am here for you </br> 
My calendar is public to you and is there should you need to find me. Please feel free to schedule any time on my calendar that you see open, no need to ask me first! If I am going to be out of the office or unavailable I will mark my calendar as such. You probably already know I live by my calendar so if it is scheduled I will be there! If it is urgent, you can always Slack or text me. If you need to reschedule a meeting no problem, just let me know your preferred time by responding to the invite and we can make that happen. </br> 
</br> I am a firm believer that meetings should start and end on time. I like to give people enough time to get to the next meeting which is why most of my meetings are either 25 or 50 minutes. Typically, I like to keep myself available in Slack and in Flywheel West as much as possible so I can be there for you when you need me! </br> 
</br> I value feedback </br> 
I am dedicated to giving you constructive and positive feedback and hope that you’ll give me the same. Formal feedback is given yearly in October during performance reviews but I aim to give continuous feedback throughout the year. If you ever would like more specific feedback from me just let me know and I’d be happy to help. I believe clear and actionable feedback helps people do their best work. I also believe safety is required to give feedback therefore it is my goal to make it safe for you to give and receive feedback. </br> 
</br> I’m big on work/life balance </br> 
Keeping a work/life balance is very important. Most of us work from 9-5ish (with respect to your local time) and unless there is an emergency I don’t expect to communicate with you outside of these hours. I sometimes respond to Slack/email during off hours but under no circumstances expect you to, unless it’s an emergency or you are on call. One thing to know about me is that I love to respond quickly but I do not expect that of you. </br> 
I take vacations and so should you! I highly encourage taking the time off you need and all I ask is that you enter your time off in Namely and communicate with the team so we can be excellent to one another!</br> 
</br> 1:1 meetings</br> 
I really see value in 1:1’s because it is a chance for me to get to know you and how you work even better. I believe these meetings are for you. This is a time for you to talk about what is on your mind. These meetings are not for status updates. I can get status in multitude of different ways including standups, Slack, Jira etc so it not necessary to talk about project status in 1:1s. I’ll provide a potential agenda ahead of time with suggestions of topics but this is totally your time. I highly encourage adding to our agenda doc if you have things to talk about, but it is not required. My goal is to have at least 30 minutes with you every other week but if you’d like to meet more that is more than okay! </br> 
</br> My asks of you </br> 
I ask that you share with me your ideas for how you want to grow in your role and how you can do your best work. Let me know if there is anything that I can do to further help and support you. I also ask that you communicate issues as soon as possible so we can come up with an action plan to resolve it. As always let’s live out our Engineering team values and stretch ourselves to reach some audacious goals! 

## 2. What I value </br> 
When something new comes up, this should help with what can you expect me to do based on my values. </br> 
* I believe in humans first. I am a people manager and I am here to help you by focusing on your career growth and happiness at Flywheel. Happy humans build the best products.
* I believe leadership can come from everywhere. Managers don’t have a monopoly on leadership and IC’s can lead in a multitude of ways. I’ve seen leadership in many areas including culture, technology, process and more.
* I believe in process that serves us well. We should always ask ourselves why a process exists if it is not making our lives easier. As a scrum master I’ve always held the belief that we should only keep process that serves the team instead of doing it because the Scrum guide tells us to. I’ve kept this mentality as a manager as well.
* I believe in assuming positive intent. At Flywheel we are all on the same team and I believe we are all trying to make the best decisions for our customers and the company.
* I believe in never being too busy for my team. My job would not exist if not for the members on my team, therefore it is my job to be here for you. If I am constantly too busy for you that is a signal to me that something needs to change. 

## 3. Who I am </br>
These are based on my top 5 Gallup Strengths and my interpretations of what they mean for me. I believe that these do accurately describe me. </br> 
* I am a futurist. This means I love to plan and I am inspired by the future.
* I am a relator. I enjoy close relationships and I love working with people I know well.
* I am responsible. I take psychological ownership of what I say I will do. I am an action taker so it is important to let me know if you don’t want action on something you are sharing with me. I am always happy to just listen if I know that’s what you need.
* I am a communicator. I take pride in communicating information well and I always strive to be better at this because I believe it is very important.
* I like to bring harmony. I often seek areas of where I can bring people together.
